You should not blame me for anything, really.  You have brought all of this upon yourself.  I am doing what needs to be done.  You are free to talk to me like a normal person.

1) you have absolutely no business keeping contact with my father.  We have been divorced many years but you still keep contact with him, calling him "Dad", saying *numerous* FALSE things to him, and continuously asking him for money (much money - I know).  This is totally wrong, and unbelievable, even I will be getting married soon, you still do this... totally wrong and inappropriate - totally strange and bizarre for your own daughter to see.

Look at yourself Joan Lang - what a shameful shameful example you are setting for your own daughter.  Please do not blame me for anything.

You have no idea how much problem YOU are causing (and for many different people) most especially Lillyanne.  It is ridiculous and repulsive and that you speak the way yo do to me, and think the way way you do - i.e. that I am causing any of this...  What u are doing is totally totally wrong.

It is funny, I actually really feel this way about u - but I never say that to you.  Why? because I have no need to do that - your life is your life - it is not my business.  But just curious, do u think u are succeeding in your own personal and professional life?  I wonder...

What I do care about is the example u set for Lillyanne; your continued breaking of agreements, continued perpetration of misleading agreements, your continued dishonest statements including lying to my father and lying to my mother.  Look at what you have done just this month alone.  


2) You have no business passing judgement on me in any way.  You really have no idea what I do and why.  In any case I am setting a clean, honest and dignified example for Lillyanne, whereas u have been unable to so in any of these ways.  This is not my opinion but simple fact based on your own actions and your own dishonest words.

Please just look at yourself if you wish to know what is wrong.  You have always been this way Joan - seeking to blame me for things that you are guilty of.

3) If you wish to eliminate "all the stupidities and negativity's" - then you should follow your own agreements; leave my family alone; and be honest.  You do these things then there will be no problems.  Very simple.

Build at the speed of Google

Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test and deploy applications on Google's highly-scalable and reliable infrastructure. Choose from computing, storage and application services for your web, mobile and backend solutions.

Go to Console


deliver Java applications to market faster than ever

build, test, and run enterprise grade applications, both in the cloud and on premise

If your orgzation is lackign in man-power or experience, we provide an ideal solution...

Use Nam to automatically generate entire software applications 
entire systems built using any (or all) of the following technologies:
JAva EE
JMS
Deployment of JBOss EAP servers using Kubernetes and Docker Containers
for Production grade deployments ranging from deployments of simple networks to deployments of scalable networks of various types - all in one integrated set of application systems. 
Allowing you to update/upgrade things seperately and independently including drivers, operating systems, application services, application components.  
Docker
Kubernetes
  -practical organzation of layers and container images.
  -clean seperation for simple and straight lifetime management 
...

This means 100% of the system is automatically generated.    

Use Nam to learn software methods for Enterprise Architecture.  

Collection of workbenches each of which focus on and address a particular areas.  

Each workbench is aasy to manage and eventually intuitive to understand. 

At this XXX moment, this site is XX % automatically generated by itself.

In our opinion, there is no better way to carry out the development of an <a>Application System</a>.  
Even application systems of arbitrary and complexity...

This is a way to design and build Java applications the may include:
  -Messaging
  -Data Caching
  -Data Grid
  -Data Persistence
  -Web UI
  -Mobile UI
  -Tablet UI

Applications may range from simple <a>standalone apps</a> to <a>larger more complex applications</a> 
to applications that have scalable, flexible, easy-to-consume cloud architecture.

You can design and generate application systems of <a>artbitrary size and complexity</a>
- without any monolithic pieces - all parts well organized and <a>self documenting</a>

Design networks.  Networks are clusters of different types of nodes.  You can design 
custom networks here - Nam will "dockerize" them for deployment into Docker based clouds.
Nam will generate your network into Kubernetes and Docker configurations.   
 
There are 3 ways to build Networks here

There are 4 ways to create software

simple enough for any business person to build any native mobile app 
Gartner, Forrester and 451 Research predict most apps will be built on codeless platforms

Result of Nam generation:
-Code, lots of well-organized code - look at results
-Maven multi-module project organization and corresponding Pom files
-Efficient organization and control of third-party dependencies

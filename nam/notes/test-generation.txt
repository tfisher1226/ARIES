Configuration, setup and maintenance of environments creates a significant barrier to a well-exercised and maintained test suite

Ideally we want to enable running tests with minimal setup. Data-intensive applications need a database, which are notoriously hard to configure and setup. We'll use a database for our tests, but instead of connecting to an external one the database will start up and run as part of the unit test. This gives us the following:

    * zero setup: no installation, no shared machine, no maintenance, no JDBC urls, no passwords
    * in-memory and fast
    * can run anywhere, even when not on a network
    * clean, with no rogue data that could affect our tests
    * no deadlocks

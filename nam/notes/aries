Aries aims to be good in two main areas: to be the most minimal in terms of work by the developer.  Aries as a system puts constraints on the types of inputs accepted as input from the developer.  There are 5 workbenches of components.  Aries aims to express the wide range of architectural contructs using the most straight-forward and intuitive set of components.  Thereby imposing structure on the types of components provided to the designer as building blocks for him/her to use in the design and architecture of their entprise applications.

It forces the designer to only have "to know" a mall set of very straight-forward conceptual elements to model their systems with.

essential components...

Aries provides organizations with a complete top-down solution for designing, defining, development and implementing complex event processing applications.

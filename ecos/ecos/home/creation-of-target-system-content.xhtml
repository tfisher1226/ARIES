					Integration with external systems
		   
					It is straight-forward to integrate with external systems such as a gateways, incoming streams, data-sources or external processing or payment systems.
		
					Integration of hand-written code
		
					We demonstrate how to integrate with hand-written code - pre-existing code, 
					or empty skeleton code to be filled in by-hand.
				</aries:p>
				
				<aries:p fontSize="13">
					Our approach can be used to <i>kick-start</i> projects by creating 
					immediate skeleton systems and tests that can be run "right of the bat."

				<aries:p fontSize="13">
					Your organization can be up and running with a solid prototype system 
					within days (or even hours).

					The value of this ability cannot be over-estimated.

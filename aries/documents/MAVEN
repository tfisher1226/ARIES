Maven

Challenge facing us now is different than before - much more diversity in dependencies; much more integration required; much more opportunity for things to go wrong; alot more interdependencies going on under the hood.  We need powerful tools to help us navigate through the mine field.

Maven is a hiearchical object oriented build and deployment system.  Think of hierarchical make-files or build-files where different levels are aware of each other in different ways: inheritance and association.  Think of having a hierarchically organized file system where a build at any given directory will have dependencies on its parents but operate on its children.

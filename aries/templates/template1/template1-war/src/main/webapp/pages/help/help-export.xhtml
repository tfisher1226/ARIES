User may export to Excel whatever data is currently displayed in the table view.  
User can double-click on an organization, bring up its members in the table view, 
then filter the table in any way the user wishes (using the filter boxes at the top of each column), 
then press the Excel button and whatever filtered data is displayed in the table then gets exported 
into Excel.  An Excel window will be popped up automatically.  If by chance the user does not have 
Excel, User can simply download/install OpenOffice (MS Office equivalent) and that will automatically 
be used instead of Excel.

Column selection 

The column selection menu can be used to determine which columns get exported into Excel.

Use these to get detailed information about what the garbage collector is doing, 
these params are a good start (substitute some preferred path and file in place of gc.log)

-XX:+PrintGCDetails 
-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps 
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime 
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime 
-Xloggc:gc.log 
-verbose:gc


If you're using a large MX (like 12GB below) it is best (or mandatory) to be using 64-bit.  
One can save the memory overhead of 64-bit addressing by using the -XX:+UseCompressedOops option. 
It will typically save about 40% of memory, so one's 12GB will go a lot further.

Depending on what one is doing, the concurrent collector might be better as well, particularly 
to reduce long GC pause times. I'd recommend trying these options as I've found them to work well:

-Xmx12g 
-XX:NewRatio=4 
-XX:SurvivorRatio=8 
-XX:+UseCompressedOops
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC 
-XX:+UseParNewGC 
-XX:+DisableExplicitGC
-XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly 
-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
-XX:+CMSScavengeBeforeRemark 
-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=68

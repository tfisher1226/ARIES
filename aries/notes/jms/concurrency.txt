you should keep a connection open for the entire life of your application.

So you should do this:

connection = cf.createConnection(...);

session = connection.createSession(...);

producer = session.createProducer(...);

The session and producer should always be used within a thread. As a session represents a thread usage. (You may reuse it within multiple threads as long as it's synchronized)

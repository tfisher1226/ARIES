Current architectural structure and choices of technologies result in many important and essential "viewports i.e. expansion directions" into the future. Give several examples here...

The relationship between the set of development artifacts that have been designed and delivered by the development team and the executable runtime environment can be defined through the management UI.  

This operation can be carried out by the deployment team which focuses on understanding and mastering how the development artifacts can be deployed to meet the needs of the user-community.



Design Artifacts (those artifacts resulting from design)
--------------------------------------------------------

Applications
Modules
Servers
Processes
Nodes


Development Artifacts (those artifacts resulting from design)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Includes:
Configuration of each specific Server and Node
Implementation of each specific Application and Module

Applications (war-files)
  -view based applications (e.g. icams-view)
  -service based applications (e.g. person-service)

Modules (jar-files)
  -client-oriented
  -model-oriented
  -data-oriented

Server configuration
  -datasource configuration
  -resource allocation (command-line parameters)

Node configuration
  -resource allocation



Relationships
----------------

Which Servers run on which Nodes
Which Applications are deployed into which Servers



Miscellaneous

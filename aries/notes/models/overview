Quote by Steve Ballmer:
 	I believe our industry has a responsibility, and an opportunity, to dramatically simplify the computing environment by seamlessly weaving together all of the devices, services and multiple layers of software into a coherent, efficiently managed technology framework.

    Any method that prevents the programmer writing code, is a good method.


The XXX pi calculus [refhere] is a language for defining, describing and analysing protocols suitable for use within a service oriented excution environment featuring long-running transactional processes.  It provides an intuitive process syntax for detailing the actions of the participants in a protocol, emphasising their communication.

The syntax is coupled with formal semantics to allow reasoning about protocols. The language is based on the pi calculus with the addition of a rich term algebra to enable modelling of the cryptographic operations used by security protocols.  A wide variety of cryptographic primitives can be abstractly modelled by means of an equational theory.

The calculus allows one to express several types of goals, and to analyse whether the target protocol implementation meets its goals or not.

Information Driven Collaborations

An ARIES 'information' document allows one to define the information types to referenced and exchanged within a choreography that will influence the observable behavior of the collaborating participants.

Participants make progress within a collaboration when acceptable pieces of information are exchanged information.  

Information Types

Information types describe the type of information used within a choreography. By introducing this abstraction, a Protocol definition avoids directly referencing the data types, as defined within a WSDL document or an XML Schema document.

Modeling of Application and Module Dependencies

Multi-level verification of distributed architectures

Exploration of predicate-based invocation mechanism (e.g. usage of when) where this construct
becomes indispensable would become important for understanding its status in structured
concurrent programming.


Precise appreciation of what high-level global abstraction would be
suitable for describing communication-centred software behaviour, and how they relate
to theirlocal (communication-based) realisation,is an important topic for future study.


Enabling of Big-data modeling with minimal and intuitive input.


As for the implementation areas, I expect alot of criticism since there are so many fundamentally differing opinions.  However, as long as the implementation structures are simple, clear and understandable, and clearly testable, the implemntation can stand up to criticism.

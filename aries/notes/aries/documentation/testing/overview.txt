We currently generate tests using Arquillian, Byteman and Mockito.

Tests are generated for each functional module that is created.   Tests are structured differently according to which type of Architectural module that the tests belong to.


Types of Tests
--------------

Unit-test
Integration-test without container (manually constructed environment)
Integration-test with container with test running as client external to container
Integration-test with container with test running internally within container 
    -test packaged as a war deployed inside of ear being tested
    -test packaged as a jar deployed inside of ear being tested
Integration-test with container with multi-ear deployment

Arquillian without
Arquillian with Byteman (which is the addition of testing of fine-grained exception handling).

All tests run using JUnit framework

NAM Engine
----------

Plugin-based where each plugin consists of a Builder and a Generator.  
The specific inputs and outputs for the builder are dependent upon what is being generated. The general idea for the Builder is that the Builder builds only what needs to be built and nothing more. And therefore the input(s) required for each Builder are specific to what is being generated.

1. Re: How to access JMX via a firewall on AS 7
in standalone.xml, depending on which interfaces you have set up in your interfaces section, try setting up these socket bindings
<socket-binding name="jmx-connector-registry" interface="management" port="1090"/>
<socket-binding name="jmx-connector-server" interface="management" port="1091"/>

 

to bind to an externally accessible interface


The only way I found to connect a jconsole to my JBoss AS 7 on EC2 to pass through a SOCKS proxy.
To start the proxy client :
    ssh -vfND 6666 -i .amazon/aws1-sewatech-net.pem ec2-user@aws1.sewatech.net  
To launch jconsole :
    jconsole -J-DsocksProxyHost=localhost -J-DsocksProxyPort=6666 aws.sewatech.net:1090

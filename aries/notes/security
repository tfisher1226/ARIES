Traditional development vs. MDA based development

For the most part, the two applications built by the teams were very similar. However, one interesting area
where the two teams diverged was in the area of security.

To address security, the traditional team used an authentication filter. This filter checks to see if the
currently requested page is restricted and, if it is, checks to see if the user is signed in (sign-in information is
stored in the HTTP Session). The team wrote this filter from scratch. The filter implements the
javax.servlet.Filter interface, supplied by Sun Microsystems.

By way of comparison, the MDA team used their MDA tool to assist with development of the security
system. Their MDA tool provided a security framework allowing them to select from a variety of
authentication methods, including simple authentication, digest-based, form-based, and programmatic. The
team chose to use the programmatic approach. The framework also provided login and logout JSP pages
that the team customized for the PetStore requirements.

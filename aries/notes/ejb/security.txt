JBoss AS7: Security : EJB3 Security
Some things to remember are:
Use the @org.jboss.ejb3.annotation.SecurityDomain   on your EJB3 beans.  Unless they are present, the security system is not enabled for the EJBs.  You can also use jboss.xml with the security-domain element, instead of the propreitary annotation.
